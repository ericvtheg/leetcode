## Notes

I initially did this my manipulating the array. It yielded the correct value, but I was unable to track index. \
I instead tracked left and right just by using the index. This was more efficient and I was able to track the index. \

Remember to keep in mind integer overflow. If I'm adding two numbers together that correlate to the index, it's possible for it to overflow.
