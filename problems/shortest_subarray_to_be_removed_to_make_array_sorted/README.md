## Notes

The gist of what I learned from this is when removing a contiguous part of an array there can only be three parts. The prefix, suffix, and the contiguous subsequence of the array that gets removed.

The sliding window part of the algorithm at the end really through me for a loop. That was an edge case I had not thought of.
