## Time Complexity 
The time complexity of the algorithm `O(n)` but requires double pass. Once for removing the non alphanumeric chars and another for doing the actual palindrome validation.

## Space Complexity 
The space complexity of the algorithm is `O(n)` since we allocate an array of length `n`.
